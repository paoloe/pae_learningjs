        <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>

        <p>I'm learning JavaScript because it was 2019's most popular language (according to
            StackOverflow's annual survey). I want to learn more about it's basic syntax to then
        go on to learn how it is used in real practice. Hopefully to get to a stage where I can do challenges
        to get a better understanding of how to apply it to problems.</p>

# Learning JavaScript

This repository contains my progress on learning JavaScript. 

The source of tutorials are currently W3Schools - This is something I am keen to learn so I'm working on it on a daily basis.

I'm learning JavaScript because it was voted the most popular language in 2019. I aim to keep up with today's technologies, I've especially taken an interest in Website Development which is why I'm learning it. I aim to also start start learning and incoporating React to the site.

## Learning Structure

Currently, I've gone back to the basics to understand the fundamental concepts of JavaScript. I'm currently following the tutorials on W3Schools https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp - I believe it is important that I do this before I take on any big challenges using JS as it might mean that I start slower but later down the line the solid understandings of the basics will mean that I am more effecient.

### Programming Language Comparisson

Recently, I wrote an assignment comparing two langauges that occupy different programming paradigms. I chose Java and JavaScript the file will soon be attached to the website. I believe that writing the assignment has truly benefited learning the fundamentals of JavaScript.

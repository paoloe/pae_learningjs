# Learning JavaScript

This repository contains my progress on learning JavaScript. 

The source of tutorials are currently W3Schools - This is something I am keen to learn so I'm working on it on a daily basis.

I'm learning JavaScript because it was voted the most popular language in 2019. I aim to keep up with today's technologies, I've especially taken an interest in Website Development which is why I'm learning it. I aim to also start start learning and incoporating React to the site.
